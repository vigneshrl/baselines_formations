# Baselines for Coordinated Multi-Robot Navigation

This repository contains baseline implementations for coordinated multi-robot navigation (MRN) methods, tested in both 3D and 2D simulation environments.

## Simulation Environments

Tests are conducted in both 3D and 2D simulators:
1. **Gazebo** (3D)
2. **Pyrobosim** (2D)

## Baseline Methods

The baselines are categorized into two groups:

### Coordinated MRN Methods
1. **DEFORM**
2. **DGNN**

### General MRN Methods
1. **ORCA**
2. **CBFs**
3. **RVO**

## Setup Instructions

### DEFORM

To run the DEFORM baseline:
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the DEFORM directory
3. Build the package (requires ROS1/Noetic):
   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
   cd <path_to_deform>
   catkin_make
   ```
