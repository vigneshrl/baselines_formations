A description about the different gazebo world scenes 

#Scenario 1: Simple static obstacles (boxes, cylinders) - good for basic testing
#Scenario 2: Dynamic obstacles that move - tests collision avoidance with moving objects
#Scenario 3: Dense static obstacles at high speed - tests quick decision making
#Scenario 4: Fast dynamic obstacles - most challenging for collision avoidance
#Scenario 5: Constrained passage with high speed - tests formation navigation through narrow spaces
#Scenario 6: Pure constrained environment - tests formation coordination in narrow corridors

#scene7 - Is the same as the scene6 world just and backup and scene8 is a dynamic world 

To run these scenes, use this command 
"gazebo <path to your world file>"
